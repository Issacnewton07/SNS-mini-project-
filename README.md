# SNS-mini-project  
Code for Graph Signal Processing for Brain Networks (EEG / fMRI)

## Overview  
This project presents an implementation of graph signal processing (GSP) techniques applied to brain network data (e.g., EEG or fMRI). The goal is to explore how classical signal processing operations—modulation, convolution, sampling—extend to signals defined on graphs, and to demonstrate them on brain connectivity graphs.

## Features  
- MATLAB script for EEG signal filtering (`EEGFiltering.m`)  
- Jupyter Notebook for graph signal processing experiments (`GSP.ipynb`)  
- C++ visualization tool (`Visualize.cpp`)  
- Example output chart (`Chart.html`)  
- Support for working with brain network graphs and signal operations defined thereon  

## Motivation  
Graph signal processing provides a powerful framework for handling data defined on non-regular domains, such as social networks, sensor networks, and brain connectivity graphs. In neuroscience, brain signals (EEG/fMRI) are often best understood when taking the underlying network structure into account. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a hands-on mini-project that marries theory with implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
- MATLAB (for `EEGFiltering.m`)  
- Python with Jupyter Notebook (for `GSP.ipynb`)  
- C++ compiler (for `Visualize.cpp`)  
- Typical supporting libraries for graph operations (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, networkx, or MATLAB’s graph toolbox)  

### Installation & Usage  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
